1. This Assignment is discussed with Haoyuan Zheng, Yuan Zhou and Siyuan Hu.
2. coding_2.pdf contains solutions to p1a and p2a.
3. p2b.launch only computes Jacobian matrix to my understanding, so there will be no moving effects of the KUKA
   youbot in simulator. Please manually check result jacobian matrices.
