(a)/rosout__agg (in published topics) and /rosout(in subscribed topics) are default topics./rosout is standard ROS topic for publishing logging messages. ROS client libraries are required to publish console logging messages to the /rosout topic as a standard interface./rosout_agg is an aggregated feed for subscribing to console logging messages. This aggregated topic is offered as a performance improvement: instead of connecting to individual ROS nodes to receive their console messages, the aggregated message feed can instead be received directly from the rosout node. (b)Now in published topics,/turtle1/color_sensor;/rosout;/turtle1/pose are added.In subscribed topics,/turtle1/cmd_vel is added.The information they contain is the message type of the correspondinng topic and how many publishers/subscribers each topic has.(c)the message type of /turtle/cmd_vel is geometry_msgs/Twist,by using "rosmsg show", this msg type expresses velocity in free space broken into its linear and angular parts, each represented as coordinate (x,y,z).the message type of /turtle1/pose is turtlesim/Pose. It contains information of x, y, theta, linear_velocity and angular_velocity of the turtle.(d)For /turtle/cmd_vel there is one subscriber,for /turtle1/pose there is one publisher.(e)Available services are as follows:/clear/kill/reset/rosout/get_loggers/rosout/set_logger_level/spawn/turtle1/set_pen/turtle1/teleport_absolute/turtle1/teleport_relative/turtlesim/get_loggers/turtlesim/set_logger_level/turtle1/teleport_absolute is what we want to move the first tutle to a certain coordinate (x,y,theta) (Note /turtle1/teleport_relative moves the first turtle a linear and angular distance from the turtle's current position)(f)rosservice find geometry_msgs/Twist
